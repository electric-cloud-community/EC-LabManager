    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
        What is the tool itself is used for in the development
        process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
        problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
        website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
        outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
        documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
        only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>VMware vCenter Lab Manager is a software development and
    testing tool that enables application owners, development, and
    QA teams to pool network and storage resources. Lab Manager
    provides users with a fully equipped data center, facilitating
    collaboration among individuals using diverse operating
    platforms and facilities.</p>

    <p>The main purpose of VMware Lab Manager is to simplify and
    streamline the process of gathering and interconnecting
    machines, installing and maintaining operating systems, adding
    and updating applications and resolving problems such as
    software bugs. VMware vCenter Lab Manager supports open,
    continuous communication among members and subgroups within a
    large, diverse development team. Users can deploy, capture, and
    share multi-tier application environments in seconds while IT
    remains in administrative control.</p>

    <p>Lab Manager supports VMware Infrastructure 3, a software
    suite designed to centralize and optimize desktop management
    and data center resources through virtualization. VMware
    vCenter Lab Manager saves time and enables unique live
    snapshot/rollback functionality for purpose-built dev/test
    environments.</p>

    <h2>VMware vCenter Lab Manager Links</h2>

    <p>More information can be found at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/labmanager/">VMware
    website</a>.</p>

    <p>Check the SOAP API guide at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/pdf/labmanager_SOAP_API_Guide.pdf">VMware
    LabManager</a>.</p>

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to VMware vCenter Lab
    Manager</h2><!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
        How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
        functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
        the plugin omit?
        -->

    <p>EC-LabManager integration uses the Lab Manager SOAP
    application programming interface (API) which provides access
    to the Lab Manager system. By using this secure API, the
    integration can connect to the Lab Manager server to automate
    and perform various operations providing a more generic
    interface for executing Lab Manager API commands and managing
    resources.</p>

    <p>The plugin interact with Lab Manager data using PERL to
    perform the following tasks:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create configuration to hold connection information.</li>

      <li>Query for virtual machine and configuration
      information.</li>

      <li>Perform actions on machines and configurations.</li>

      <li>Capture, checkout, clone, delete, and deploy
      configurations.</li>

      <li>Create ElectricFlow resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This plugin provides two primary actions: Provision and
    Cleanup, which work as a pair within a job.</p>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against VMware vCenter
    Lab Manager versions 3.0 and 4.0</p>

    <p>ElectricFlow minimum version 4.0</p>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class="required">bold
    italics</span>.</p>

    <div id="CreateConfiguration"><a name="CreateConfiguration" id="CreateConfiguration"></a>

    <h3>Plugin Configuration</h3>
    <!-- If the plugin has separate configurations then include this section,
        otherwise omit this whole section. We don't need to have a configuration
        section that just says "There is no configuration for this plugin."
        -->

    <p>Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
    across some or all of the plugin's procedures. They are
    intended to reduce repetition of common values, create
    predefined sets of parameters for end users, and to securely
    store credentials where needed. Each configuration is given a
    unique name that is entered in designated parameters on
    procedures that use them.<br />
    <br />
    Plugin configurations are created by going to the Electric
    Commander "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab.
    On the right side of the line for the EC-LabManager plugin,
    there is a "Configure" link which will open the Configuration
    page.</p>
    <!-- For all parameters, the parameter name should be *exactly* the same as it appears in the
    Parameter Panel, and the first sentence(s) of the description should be
    the same as the tooltip (if there is one). After that, the parameter
    description can go into greater detail about the parameter including
    valid value ranges and examples.

    <h3>Provision</h3>

    <p>This procedure allows users to provision a new configuration
    using the VMWare Lab Manager API. Run this procedure to create
    and deploy a new Lab Manager configuration and create resources
    for machines in the new configuration.<br />
    The plugin will set properties on the ElectricFlow server
    using the values from "Results location" and "Provision tag".
    Users can set the location where they want properties to be
    stored by specifying the "Results location" field, if this
    field is blank, the default location in the job is used:
    /myJob/LabManager/deployed_configs. When this procedure is
    executed, properties will be stored in "Results
    location"/"Provision tag". If "Create resources?" is checked,
    the resources will use the "Commander Workspace" and will be
    assigned to "Resource Pool(s)", If it is unchecked "Resource
    Pool(s)" and "Commander Workspace" will be ignored.</p>

    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This procedure is intended to
    run on Lab Manager 3.5 or earlier ONLY. See procedure:
    Provision4.0</p>

    implemented in LabManager 4.0, this procedure is not available
    for earlier LabManager versions. Run this procedure to create
    and deploy a new Lab Manager configuration and create resources
    for machines in the new configuration.<br />

    <h3>Cleanup</h3>

    <p>This procedure allows users to clean up a configuration
    using the VMWare LabManager API. It verifies if the
    configuration to be cleaned up is already undeployed before
    shutting down machines, shutting down the configuration and
    undeploying the configuration to avoid errors. Existing
    Commander resources associated with VMs in the configuration
    that are cleaned up will be deleted.<br />
    If "Configuration" is set the procedure will get its
    information and will undeploy and delete its associated
    resources, if this parameter is empty the procedure will get
    the provision results from "Deployed Results
    location"/"Deployed tag" for a configuration to cleanup. If the
    "Deployed Results location" field is blank, the default
    location in the job is used:
    /myJob/LabManager/deployed_configs.<br />
    The plugin will set properties on the ElectricFlow server

    Users can set the location where they want properties to be
    stored by specifying the "Results location" field, if this

    CreateConfigurationFromVMTemplate4.0 also allows you to specify
    the fence policy, deployment lease, and storage lease; as well
    as a subset of VMs to deploy. Because these features were
    implemented in Lab Manager 4.0, this procedure is not available
    for previous Lab Manager versions.<br />
    The plugin will set properties on the ElectricFlow server
    using the values from "Results location" and "Provision tag".

    <h3>CreateResourcesFromConfiguration</h3>

    <p>This procedure allows the user to create a resource for each
    virtual machine of a configuration or for specified virtual
    machines.<br />
    Created resources will use the "Commander Workspace" and will
    be assigned to "Resource Pool(s)", if "Commander Workspace" is
    blank, default workspace will be used, if "Resource Pool(s)" is
    blank, resources will be assigned to "EC-$[JobStepId]"
    pool.<br />
    The plugin will set properties on the ElectricFlow server
    using the values from "Results location" and "Results tag".
    Users can set the location where they want properties to be
    stored by specifying the "Results location" field, if this
    field is blank, the default location in the job is used:
    /myJob/LabManager/deployed_configs. When this procedure is
    executed, properties will be stored in "Results
    location"/"Results tag".</p>

    <h1>Examples and Use Cases</h1>
    <!-- This section is for examples and use cases, including screenshots of the new Parameter Panel with example values filled in.
        Unfortunately, I can't tell you what exactly to put here, but it's OK to put what seems like too much! Include both parameter
        values and output where appropriate. Use a separate 'h2' header for each example. Under the h2 header try to stay with the style
        outline used above where possible.

    <h2>Use Case 1: Provision, Consume &amp; Cleanup Job</h2>

    <p>The most common use for this plugin is to create a virtual
    machine, then create an ElectricFlow resource assigned to
    this machine, use the resource to run some operations, and the
    delete the resource and the virtual machine. To accomplish
    these tasks you must:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create a Plugin Configuration.</li>

      <li>Provision a LabManager Configuration.</li>

      <li>Create a Resource for this provision.</li>

      <li>Use the created resource.</li>

      <li>Delete the resource.</li>

      <li>Delete the provisioned VM.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Create a Plugin Configuration</h4>

    <p>Plugin configurations are created by going to the Electric
    Commander "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab.
    On the right side of the line for the LabManager plugin, there
    is a "Configure" link which will open the Configuration
    page.<br />
    Create a new configuration by specifying the requested
    parameters:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/create_config.png" />

    <p>Once the configuration is created, you can see it listed in
    "Lab Manager Configurations", and now you are able to provision
    a new VM.</p>

    <h4>Provision</h4>

    <p>Create a new Provision procedure, fill in the requested
    parameters with real values from your Labmanager
    server:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/provision_parameters.png" />

    <p>Make sure you selected "Create resources?" checkbox.</p>

    <h4>Consume</h4>

    <p>Create a new command step to use the created resource, in
    this example we will pick a resource from the pool and just add
    an ec-perl sleep to use it for 30 seconds</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/consume_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Cleanup</h4>

    <p>Now the resource has been used and is ready to be cleaned
    up, create a Cleanup step, fill in the requested parameters, in
    this example we will use "Deployed Results Location" to select
    the configuration to clean instead of provide a specific
    "Configuration":</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/cleanup_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Results and outputs</h4>

    <p>Once the job finished, you can see properties stored in
    "Results Location".<br />
    <img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/job.png" /></p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/results.png" />

    <p>Provision output:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/provision_log.png" />

    <p>Cleanup output:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/cleanup_log.png" />
